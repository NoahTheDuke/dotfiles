# dotfiles

A repository for all of my dotfiles!

## Symlinks

* `nvim/` -> `~/.config/nvim`
* `beets/` -> `~/.config/beets`
* `jj/` -> `~/.config/jj`. Create `jj/conf.d/work.toml` with your work email.

Powershell
==========

(Probably outdated? I haven't used a windows machine in 10 years :eyes:)

Move the DraculaPowerShell folder to the Powershell Modules folder, then run:

```powershell
Import-Module DraculaPowerShell
New-DraculaPowerShell "Dracula PowerShell"
```

This will create a powershell file with the changes applied. Use that as the link for all powershell uses.
