dotfiles
========

A repository for all of my dotfiles!

Notes
=====

Move the DraculaPowerShell folder to the Powershell Modules folder, then run:

    Import-Module DraculaPowerShell
    New-DraculaPowerShell "Dracula PowerShell"

This will create a powershell file with the changes applied. Use that as the link for all powershell uses.
