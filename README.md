dotfiles
========

A repository for all of my dotfiles!

Powershell
==========

(Probably outdated? I haven't used a windows machine in 5 years :eyes:)

Move the DraculaPowerShell folder to the Powershell Modules folder, then run:

    Import-Module DraculaPowerShell
    New-DraculaPowerShell "Dracula PowerShell"

This will create a powershell file with the changes applied. Use that as the link for all powershell uses.

Neovim
======

Symlink `nvim/` to `~/.config/nvim` or `~/AppData/Local/nvim` as appropriate and then you're good to go.

Beets
=====

Symlink `beets/config.yaml` to `~/.config/beets/config.yaml`.
