In maternity stuff i wear 10/12 pants, M shirt if it’s loose/slowly, L if it’s form fitting
In regular clothes right now probably large
Large for unisex def and women’s if it’s loosish , Maybe xl if it’s tight women’s sizing
I can’t really wear non-maternity pants unless their stretchy and probably L or XL depending if there meant to be tight or loose
